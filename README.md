## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Wi-Fi enabled robot that can detect humans and track their location in real-time. The system utilizes:
- An ESP32 microcontroller with CSI (Channel State Information) for detecting motion through Wi-Fi signal analysis.
- A PS3 controller for remote control of the robot.
- GPS tracking for monitoring location.
- A camera server for live video feed.

Here is an overview of the main folders and files in this repository:

- **CAD/**: Contains CAD design files for the robot's physical structure.
- **CameraWebServer/**: Contains the code for setting up a live video feed using ESP32's camera capabilities.
- **ps3 controller/**: Code to set up and use a PS3 controller with the ESP32.
- **wifi see through esp32/**: CSI-based motion detection code using ESP32.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and setup instructions for the project.
- **WI-SNAKEBOT_report.docx**: Project report with detailed information about the design, implementation, and results.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. ESP32 Board Setup
1. **Install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE**:
   - Open Arduino IDE, go to **File** > **Preferences**.
   - In **Additional Board Manager URLs**, enter: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`.
   - Go to **Tools** > **Board** > **Boards Manager**, search for **ESP32** and install it.

2. **Library Installation**:
   - Install the **ESP32 WiFi** and **ESP32 Camera** libraries.
   - For PS3 controller support, install the `esp32-ps3` library.

3. **Driver Installation**:
   - If you haven’t already, install the USB-to-Serial driver for ESP32, depending on your operating system.

### 2. Project Code
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/myasin3/Main-project.git
  cd Main-project
  ```

### 3. Setting Up Individual Components
Each component of the project has its dedicated folder and setup instructions.

#### A. Camera Web Server
1. Open the **CameraWebServer** folder in Arduino IDE.
2. Select the appropriate board (e.g., ESP32 Wrover Module) and COM port.
3. Upload the code to ESP32.
4. After uploading, open the Serial Monitor and check for the IP address printed by the ESP32.
5. Visit the IP address in a browser to access the live video feed.

#### B. PS3 Controller
1. Open the **ps3 controller** folder in Arduino IDE.
2. Set up Bluetooth pairing between the PS3 controller and ESP32 by following the instructions in the code comments.
3. Upload the code and test the controller’s input in the Serial Monitor.

#### C. Wi-Fi Motion Detection
1. Open the **wifi see through esp32** folder in Arduino IDE.
2. Configure the Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
3. Upload the code to ESP32.
4. This code will analyze changes in Wi-Fi signal strength to detect motion.

## Running the Project

1. **Power the ESP32**: Make sure it is powered and connected to your network.
2. **Connect the GPS Module** (if applicable): This will be used for tracking location in real time.
3. **Enable Camera Feed**: Access the camera feed through the IP address shown in the Serial Monitor.
4. **Use the PS3 Controller**: Ensure that the controller is paired with ESP32, allowing you to control the robot remotely.

## Usage
- **Camera Feed**: Open the web server link in a browser to view the live feed.
- **Motion Detection**: The ESP32 monitors Wi-Fi signal changes and triggers actions if motion is detected.
- **GPS Tracking**: Continuously monitors the robot's location and displays it on the console.

## Documentation
- **Project Report**: Detailed documentation can be found in `WI-SNAKEBOT_report.docx`.
- **Presentations**: Initial and final presentations (`ppt_main_project_last.pdf` and `ppt_main_project_ref_phase_1.pdf`) provide summaries and key insights.
